Assignment 1: Rational Agent Design

Objective:

Instructions:
1. Define the environment in which your agent operates.
2. Clearly describe:
   - Performance Measure
   - Environment
   - Actuators
   - Sensors
3. Provide a diagram of the agent architecture.
4. Explain whether the environment is:
   - Fully or partially observable
   - Deterministic or stochastic
   - Episodic or sequential
   - Static or dynamic
   - Discrete or continuous

Deliverables:
- 2–3 page PDF report
- Architecture diagram
- Formal PEAS table

Due Date:
February 25 at 11:59 PM

Grading Criteria:
- Clarity of PEAS definition
- Correct classification of the environment
- Quality of reasoning
- Diagram clarity
